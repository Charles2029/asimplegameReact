App.js 的代码创建了一个 组件。在 React 中，组件是一段可重用代码，它通常作为 UI 界面的一部分。组件用于渲染、管理和更新应用中的 UI 元素。让我们逐行查看这段代码，看看发生了什么：
/The code in App.js creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. Let’s look at the component line by line to see what’s going on:

export default function Square() {
  return <button className="square">X</button>;
}

//
The first line defines a function called Square. The export JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file. The default keyword tells other files using your code that it’s the main function in your file.

第二行返回一个按钮。JavaScript 的 return 关键字意味着后面的内容都作为值返回给函数的调用者。<button> 是一个 JSX 元素。JSX 元素是 JavaScript 代码和 HTML 标签的组合，用于描述要显示的内容。className="square" 是一个 button 属性，它决定 CSS 如何设置按钮的样式。X 是按钮内显示的文本，</button> 闭合 JSX 元素以表示不应将任何后续内容放置在按钮内

The second line returns a button. The return JavaScript keyword means whatever comes after is returned as a value to the caller of the function. <button> is a JSX element. A JSX element is a combination of JavaScript code and HTML tags that describes what you’d like to display. className="square" is a button property or prop that tells CSS how to style the button. X is the text displayed inside of the button and </button> closes the JSX element to indicate that any following content shouldn’t be placed inside the button.
